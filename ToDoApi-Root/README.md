# Summary
This is a sample dot net core project with VS Code .
Pretty much  how cases a vanilla scafolding with NSuperTest Unt Tests .

## Purpose
This is to demonstrate how to use NSuperTest for your quality checks  which IMO is superior to the standard NUnit Unit testing framworks.
The **main differentiator**  is that this approach excersises the HTTP Pipeline too so it validates the MVC serilaization as well as standard WebApi functionality.
